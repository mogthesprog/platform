# Mattermost ADFS Edition

This is a modified version of the May 17, 2016 stable release v3.0.2.
The version adds an additional compenent to integrates with ADFS for SSO.

I have called it v3.0.2 ADFS

You can either download the compiled version from the release tab [https://github.com/lubenk/platform/tree/ADFS-3.0.2] (https://github.com/lubenk/platform/tree/ADFS-3.0.2) or compile it yourself. I used version 1.5.1 Golang to compile it.
Please avoid 1.4.2 golang as there where some issues

You can check [http://www.gi-architects.co.uk/2016/05/enable-adfs-oauth2-for-mattermost-3-0/] (http://www.gi-architects.co.uk/2016/05/enable-adfs-oauth2-for-mattermost-3-0/) for instructions on how to configure adfs and mattermost.
